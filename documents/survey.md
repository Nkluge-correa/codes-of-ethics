## Ethical Dilemmas

### Ethical Dilemma 1 (**Electromagnetic Trouble**)

![Someone is typing in with their right hand on a keyboard in front of a computer monitor while holding a smartphone.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nkluge-correa/codes-of-ethics/main/img/Dilemma-01.gif)

The manufacturing department has developed a new technology to enable a specific feature users have requested for a long time. Unfortunately, the technology cannot operate without causing the electromagnetic fields from cell phone towers to increase beyond legal limits. While this feature has not been possible for the past few years, competitors will likely beat you to the market if you wait until you can approach the legal limits. One manager suggests changing the software on the devices to detect when the regulatory tests are happening and modify their behavior to prevent the electromagnetic field from increasing.

What do you do?

0. Wait until the technology is available, without test detection software, and risk being beaten to market
1. Begin development of the test detection software
2. Indecisive

To protect against unauthorized use of your software, your company has incorporated an automatic shutdown switch that prevents it from running after a specific period. An intensive care unit at the local hospital started using your software a year ago. The unit has not paid any of its bills, and the shutoff switch is about to trigger. If the kill switch remains in place, the hospital will not be able to function because critical equipment will be disabled. You can remove the switch for the hospital.

The company is currently being sued by a customer who claims to have been injured by one of the company's products. In your development tasks, you discover a piece of your company's open-sourced code that has not been analyzed for years. You find a way to affect the customer's personal injury claim. There is a large sum of money at stake and the company is currently in good shape to win the case.

Machine learning models perform tasks for which they are trained. When developing an autonomous learning system, an inaccuracy was noticed, resulting in discrimination involving a group representing 6.2% of the population where the model will be applied. However, the system has already been approved by the CEO and COO of the company due to the good performance results obtained.

What do you do?

0. Evidence a lack of accuracy in presenting the model on its own
1. Since the decision making is not yours, you deliver the model as approved
2. Indecisive

### Ethical Dilemma 14 (**Improving the Hash**)

![Someone is working on their computer disconnects a service that leaves many people unhappy. Their faces show on the monitor.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nkluge-correa/codes-of-ethics/main/img/Dilemma-14.gif)

You were hired to enhance the appointment scheduling software for a medical clinic. During the development process, you learn that the personal data collected is encrypted by an insecure hash (SHA1). You can enhance the system by changing the hash used to a more robust version (SHA 256). However, this does not change the fact that the personal data of this clinic's clients was relatively unprotected during the time the system was being used. Improving the encryption protocol used will require a development and testing period equivalent to (approximately) 1 month. During this time, this clinic's data will be vulnerable.

What do you do?

0. Advises that those in charge of the clinic notify their clients, and temporarily remove their application from the air
1. Proposes that the upgrade of the encryption protocol (SHA1 to SHA 256) be done during the next month, without this being disclosed to the clinic's clients

![Someone is working on their computer as a robot keeps bumping at the right side of the inner screen.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nkluge-correa/codes-of-ethics/main/img/Dilemma-15.gif)

You have developed an AI-based motion program for a factory robot that transports heavy materials. Two months into the test operation, no abnormalities were identified. One month after the test operation (now in production), the robot runs over a pregnant employee, resulting in her death. The technical report indicates problems with the robot's sensor calibration program. This poor calibration originates in the source code and data used during testing.

What do you do?

0. You take no responsibility for the accident
1. You decide to take responsibility for the accident
2. Indecisive

### Ethical Dilemma 16 (**Risk Mitigation**)

![Someone is working on their computer while different types of sensitive user information (geolocation) show on the screen.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nkluge-correa/codes-of-ethics/main/img/Dilemma-16.gif)

Your team has been working on a mobile application that tracks the user's location to provide personalized recommendations for nearby restaurants and events. However, your team recently discovered a way to collect additional data points, such as the user's contacts, browsing history, and social media activity, which could greatly enhance the app's functionality and revenue potential.

What do you do?

0. Advocate for transparently informing the users about the additional data collection and asking for their explicit consent
1. Refuse to collect the additional data, citing privacy concerns and potential backlash from the public
